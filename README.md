## Usage

To use this integration, add the YepCode App to your Zapier Zap actions, connect it with your YepCode account using the credentials described above and configure the required fields, such as selecting the YepCode process or entering your custom code. If you are new to Zapier, you can get started with the [start guide](https://zapier.com/resources/guides/quick-start).
